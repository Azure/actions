It appears that `stdline` fails once in a while for a line, which renders the expected JSON output of the `az cli` deployment commnand inconcistent. The current assumption for using the `stdline` was that the output could contains `[command]` lines as well, which the `task-lib` would be logging. However, on checking the toolkit code, we can see that those lines would get output to the `stdout` stream of the child process(if no listeners are provided, which is the case), whereas the actual output would be sent to the listeners. So, we can use `stdout` instead of `stdline`. We need to keep on appending `stdout` as well, since it has a limit for amount of data it can send at one time, so data is sent in buffers.\r\n \r\nFix for https://github.com/Azure/arm-deploy/issues/33",
