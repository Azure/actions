# Introduction to GitHub Actions for Azure and Starter Action Workflows

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions)  gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. 

With [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://azure.github.io/actions/) you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release and **deploy** to Azure. [Learn more about all other integrations with Azure.](http://aka.ms/GitHubonAzure)

To easily create GitHub CI/CD workflows targeting Azure, use our [Azure starter templates](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples) to deploy your apps created with popular languages and frameworks such as .NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, Ruby or Python, in containers or running on any operating system. Also the individual Action repos have a sample workflow included in their Readme file to help you quickly get started.

Please try out the [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/github-actions) and share your feedback via Twitter on [@Azure](https://twitter.com/azuredevops). If you encounter a problem, please open an issue on the GitHub repository for the specific action.
